# UFOs

## Overview of Project

We've been provided a JavaScript file chock full of data about UFO sightings, including countries, cities, states, and a whole lot more. Our first task is display the data as a table using JavaScript. However, because there is so much data, sifting thriugh it without any adjusments would be a challange but luckily JavaScript provides a way to manipulate the data by adding filters.

Next, we need to organize everything into a neat HTML page, including the article, the data table that supports the findings, and simple filters that can be used to fine-tune the results.

## Results:
If you click at this link https://verafleming.github.io/UFOs/ you can see the web page we did. It looks pretty interactive and eye catching webpage.At the top of the page you can see header with customized background.

Right after a header you can see our article:

Down below the article you can see the table which we coded:

On the left of the table we located our filters:

The filtered data will appear in the new table as soon as you enter your input and press Enter or Return, due to the way our JavaScript code was written.
For example we can ented the date and we can see the table with just chosen dates:

Only the results with sightings in Florida will appear in the new table if we enter "fl" in the "Enter the State" box and then press Enter or Return.

## Summary:

Everything works weel in our code and web page looks great, but there is one drawback I would fix. When you enter the input in the filter box and there are no matching criteria then nothing is showing, which is a bit confusing. I would suggest to add a messege which would notify us about it. 

Additionally, if we could include more filters, like sorting by the most to the small amounts sightings, it would be more dynamic. Or another way to develope the web page even more advance would be adding a dropdown menu to our filters.
